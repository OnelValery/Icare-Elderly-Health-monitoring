### **🎬 Movie Recommendation System**

This project implements a movie recommendation system using a dataset to predict movies based on user preferences. The recommendation engine is developed in four different programming languages (Java, Go, Prolog, and Scheme), showcasing different paradigms and approaches to the task.

**🚀 Project Overview**

This system uses collaborative filtering techniques and data from the X dataset to recommend movies to users. The recommendation system is implemented in Java, Go, Prolog, and Scheme, each demonstrating unique features and advantages in handling the data.

**📦 Features**

- Movie recommendation based on user preferences
- Data handling using multiple programming languages
- Various recommendation techniques (collaborative filtering, content-based)
- Language-specific implementations for comparison

**🔧 Technologies Used**

**- Java:** Object-Oriented Programming for handling recommendations and user data

**- Go:** Concurrent programming to efficiently handle multiple user queries

**- Prolog:** Logic programming for defining rules and handling user preferences

**- Scheme:** Functional programming for a minimalist approach to recommendation logic

**📊 Dataset Used**

- X dataset, which includes movie information like genres, ratings, and user preferences

**🧠 Key Functionalities**

- 📚 Recommendation algorithms in Java, Go, Prolog, and Scheme
- 🔍 Efficient querying and data processing
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaborative filtering and content-based techniques
- 🎬 Movie suggestions based on user input and historical data
